# INSURANCE-ANALYSIS
# 🧾 Insurance Analytics Dashboard

## 📊 Overview
This project showcases a comprehensive **Insurance Analytics Dashboard** built using **Excel, Power BI, and Tableau**.  
The goal is to analyze insurance data across multiple KPIs, visualize performance, and provide actionable insights for business decision-making.
---

## 🧠 Project Objective
To create an end-to-end insurance analytics solution that:
- Cleans and integrates raw data  
- Establishes relational models using bridge tables  
- Calculates and visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs)  
- Demonstrates consistent analytical logic across multiple BI tools: Excel, Power BI, and Tableau

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Excel** | Quick summaries and basic visual analysis |
| **Power BI** | Interactive dashboards with real-time filtering and drill-through analysis |
| **Tableau** | Visually rich dashboards for identifying trends and performance patterns |

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning (in Power Query)
### Before Cleaning
- Duplicate `Account Executive IDs`  
- Missing `Account Executive IDs`  

### After Cleaning
- Removed duplicates  
- Added missing IDs where null values existed  
- Ensured consistent and reliable dataset for further modeling  

---

## 🧮 Data Modeling (Power Pivot)
- Two **bridge tables** were created to avoid **many-to-many relationships**:
  - `Dim_Account`
  - `Sheet1`
- Relationships were established among core data tables for seamless analysis across tools.

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
A total of **six KPIs** were developed and implemented consistently in all platforms.

| # | KPI | Description |
|---|-----|-------------|
| 1 | **Number of Invoices by Account Executive** | Tracks invoices generated by each executive |
| 2 | **Yearly Meeting Count** | Monitors annual client meeting frequency |
| 3 | **Cross-Sell (Target, Achievement, New)** | Evaluates performance of cross-sell opportunities |
| 4 | **New Business (Target, Achievement, New)** | Measures new client acquisition performance |
| 5 | **Renewal (Target, Achievement, New)** | Assesses renewal business performance |
| 6 | **Stage Funnel by Revenue** | Shows revenue progression across sales stages |
| 7 | **Top Open Opportunities** | Highlights top pending opportunities by revenue |

> *Note:* The KPI numbering in the presentation repeated “3”; it’s consolidated here for clarity.

## ⚙️ Calculations & Logic

| Metric | Formula | Source |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Target** | Cross Sell + New + Renewal (from *Individual Budget*) | Excel / Power BI / Tableau |
| **Achievement** | Brokerage Amount + Fees Amount | Derived Measure |
| **Invoice** | Amount from *Invoice Table* | Raw Data |
| **% Achievement (Placed)** | `(Achievement / Target)` | Calculated |
| **% Achievement (Invoice)** | `(Invoice / Target)` | Calculated |

---

## 💡 Highlights
- Built a **complete analytical pipeline** — from data cleaning to multi-tool visualization  
- Implemented **six unified KPIs** across **Excel, Power BI, and Tableau**  
- Ensured **data consistency and relational accuracy** through bridge tables  
- Achieved **cross-platform validation** of business logic  

---

## 🚧 Challenges
- The main challenge was implementing the **third KPI (Cross-Sell)** consistently across all platforms  
  - Logic remained the same, but implementation syntax varied between tools  
- Data integration and relational modeling required careful handling of nulls and duplicates  

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with **data cleaning, modeling, and visualization**  
- Hands-on exposure to **cross-platform analytics** (Excel, Power BI, Tableau)  
- Understanding of **KPI standardization** and data relationship management  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
The **Insurance Analytics Dashboard** demonstrates the power of integrated business analytics using a unified KPI framework across multiple BI tools.  
It highlights how consistent logic, clean data, and relational design can yield reliable, cross-verifiable insights for the insurance domain.
